# Product Requirements Document - TheFlightWall

**Author:** Christian
**Date:** 2026-04-02

## Executive Summary

TheFlightWall is an ESP32-powered LED wall that displays live flight information for aircraft passing near your location. The existing firmware fetches ADS-B position data from OpenSky Network, enriches it with airline, aircraft, and route metadata from FlightAware AeroAPI and a CDN lookup service, and renders flight cards on a WS2812B NeoPixel LED matrix.

This PRD defines two major enhancements that transform TheFlightWall from a developer-oriented maker project into a self-contained, configurable product:

1. **Web Configuration Portal** — An ESP32-hosted web interface with captive portal setup wizard and local network config UI. All settings (WiFi, API keys, location, display hardware, timing) move from compile-time C++ headers to persistent NVS storage, editable from any browser. Includes a live HTML5 canvas preview of the matrix layout and a display calibration tool.

2. **Enhanced Display with Airline Logos** — A responsive zone-based display layout supporting airline logo bitmaps (32x32 RGB565), a three-line flight card (airline, route, aircraft), and live telemetry (altitude, speed, track, vertical rate). The layout adapts dynamically to any panel configuration, from compact single-row setups to expanded multi-row arrangements.

The target user is the project owner (personal project). The goal is a device you plug in, configure from your phone, and mount on the wall — no PlatformIO, no code editing, no reflashing required.

## What Makes This Special

The product is not just the LED display — it's the unified device-plus-web-UI experience. The display is the output; the web interface is the product surface. Together they turn custom hardware into something anyone with the components can set up and customize without writing a line of code. The live browser preview of the matrix layout means configuration is visual and immediate, not trial-and-error.

## Project Classification

- **Project Type:** IoT/Embedded — ESP32 device with WiFi connectivity, external API integrations, LED matrix display, and browser-based companion interface
- **Domain:** General (aviation data consumer) — no regulatory, safety, or compliance requirements
- **Complexity:** Low-Medium — hardware/firmware with multiple external APIs and a web UI component, but single-user personal project with no multi-tenancy, auth, or scale concerns
- **Project Context:** Brownfield — enhancing existing working firmware with hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) architecture

## Success Criteria

### User Success

- First-boot setup: connect to ESP32 AP from phone, complete setup wizard (WiFi, API keys, location, hardware), and see live flights on display — no code editing or reflashing
- Change any setting from the web UI and see it reflected on the LED wall
- Display-only settings (brightness, color, layout) apply within 1 second (hot-reload). Network/API settings require reboot with clear user feedback ("Rebooting to apply changes...")
- Display shows airline logo, flight card, and live telemetry matching the reference layout
- Swap to a different panel arrangement, reconfigure tile count in web UI, and the layout adapts automatically

### Technical Success

- All configuration persisted in NVS — survives power cycles
- Captive portal AP mode works on first boot and when saved WiFi is unavailable
- Existing fetch → enrich → display pipeline works identically after refactor (regression baseline)
- Responsive layout renders correctly across different matrix dimensions (compact/full/expanded breakpoints)
- Logo bitmaps load from LittleFS by ICAO code with fallback airplane sprite
- Live preview canvas accurately represents actual LED matrix layout and zone positions
- Firmware + web assets (HTML/JS/CSS) + bundled logos fit within 4MB flash with at least 500KB headroom

### Measurable Outcomes

- **Post-Epic 1 smoke test:** Flash firmware → ESP32 broadcasts AP → connect from phone → complete setup wizard → ESP32 joins home WiFi → flights appear on display
- **Post-Epic 2 smoke test:** Same flow, but display shows logo + flight card + telemetry in new layout. Verified with at least two tile configurations (e.g., 10x2 and 5x2)

## Product Scope & Phased Development

### MVP Strategy

**Approach:** Problem-solving MVP — deliver the two core capabilities (web config + enhanced display) that transform the project from "editable source code" to "configurable product."

**Resource Requirements:** Solo developer (Christian) with AI-assisted development. No team dependencies.

### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)

**Core User Journeys Supported:**
- Journey 1 (First-Time Setup) — full captive portal → config → live flights
- Journey 2 (Tweaking Settings) — config UI with hot-reload and reboot flow
- Journey 3 (New Panel Layout) — responsive layout + calibration + live preview
- Journey 4 (Adding Logos) — logo upload + LittleFS management

**Must-Have Capabilities (Epic 1 — Web Config Portal):**
- ConfigManager: NVS read/write with typed getters and compile-time defaults as fallback
- WebPortal: ESPAsyncWebServer + LittleFS serving HTML/JS/CSS
- Captive portal: AP mode setup wizard (WiFi → API keys → location → hardware → display calibration)
- Config UI: Full settings dashboard on local network, organized by section
- Logo management: Upload page for .bin files to LittleFS
- Live preview: HTML5 canvas showing matrix layout, zones, and calibration in real-time
- Apply flow: Hot-reload for display settings (<1s), reboot with feedback for network/API changes

**Must-Have Capabilities (Epic 2 — Enhanced Display):**

- Additional data source integrations

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: First-Time Setup — "Unboxing Day"

Christian just finished soldering the last panel, wiring the ESP32, and loading the firmware. He powers it on for the first time. The display flashes "FlightWall" and then broadcasts a WiFi network: `FlightWall-Setup`.

He pulls out his phone, connects to the AP, and a browser automatically opens the setup wizard. Step one: enter home WiFi credentials. Step two: paste in OpenSky and AeroAPI keys. Step three: type in his latitude, longitude, and a 10km radius. Step four: confirm the tile layout (10x2 at 16x16) and see the live preview canvas show the zone layout — logo area on the left, flight card top-right, telemetry bottom.

He hits "Save & Connect." The display shows "Connecting to WiFi..." then "WiFi OK" and switches to the loading screen. Thirty seconds later, the first flight card appears — a Southwest 737 descending into the nearby airport, complete with logo, route, and altitude readout.

**The moment:** It works. From bare hardware to live flight data, entirely from his phone. No laptop, no IDE, no terminal.

**Reveals requirements for:** Captive portal, setup wizard flow, NVS persistence, WiFi STA transition, first-fetch display

### Journey 2: Tweaking Settings — "Saturday Afternoon Customization"

Christian is sitting on the couch looking at the FlightWall. The text is a bit bright for the evening. He opens his phone browser, types in the ESP32's local IP, and lands on the config dashboard. He drops the brightness from 50 to 15, changes the text color from white to amber. The LED wall updates instantly — no reboot, no waiting for the next fetch cycle.

He also decides to widen his search radius from 10km to 25km to catch more flights. He updates the location setting and hits "Apply." The page shows "Rebooting to apply network changes..." and the wall briefly goes dark, then comes back with flights from a wider area.

**The moment:** The feedback loop is instant for visual changes and transparent for deeper changes. It feels like controlling a smart home device, not reprogramming firmware.

**Reveals requirements for:** Config UI sections, hot-reload for display settings, reboot flow for API/network settings, clear user feedback

### Journey 3: New Panel Layout — "The Upgrade"

Christian bought more LED panels and expanded from 10x2 to 12x3. He opens the config UI, changes Tiles X to 12 and Tiles Y to 3. The live preview canvas immediately shows the new 192x48 resolution with the expanded layout — the logo area is now 48x48, more room for the flight card, and the telemetry section has space for additional data.

He checks the layout mode indicator: "Expanded (48px+ height)." The wiring flags need adjusting for the new panels — he toggles the tile origin and scan direction using the calibration dropdowns while a test pattern renders on the actual LEDs until it looks correct.

He saves, the display reinitializes, and the next flight card fills the larger display beautifully.

**The moment:** The hardware changed but the software adapted — no code changes, just a few clicks.

**Reveals requirements for:** Responsive layout engine, breakpoint detection, live preview canvas with real-time updates, display calibration tool, hot-reload for hardware config

### Journey 4: Adding Airline Logos — "Logo Day"

Christian has prepared a batch of airline logo `.bin` files (32x32 RGB565) for the top 30 airlines in his area. He opens the config UI, navigates to the Logo Management section, and drags the files onto the upload area. A progress indicator shows them uploading to LittleFS. The page confirms: "28 logos uploaded, 2 failed (file too large)."

He fixes the two oversized files, re-uploads, and all 30 are now stored. The next time a United flight appears, the blue globe logo renders in the left panel instead of the generic airplane icon.

**The moment:** The display transforms from functional to polished — real airline branding on a homemade LED wall.

**Reveals requirements for:** Logo upload UI, LittleFS file management, file validation (size/format), LogoManager ICAO lookup, fallback sprite

### Journey 5: Recovery & Maintenance — "Something's Wrong"

Christian notices the FlightWall hasn't updated in a while. He grabs his phone to check — but he can't remember the ESP32's IP address. He glances at the LED wall and sees the IP displayed briefly after the last reboot: `192.168.1.47`. He types it into his browser and the config dashboard loads. The WiFi section shows the device is connected, but the API status shows repeated failures — his AeroAPI key expired.

He pastes in the new key, hits Apply, and the device reboots. Flights reappear within a minute.

A month later, Christian has been experimenting with settings and wants a clean slate. He opens the config dashboard, scrolls to the bottom, and hits "Reset to Defaults." The page confirms: "All settings will be erased. Device will restart in setup mode." He confirms, and the FlightWall reboots into AP mode, broadcasting `FlightWall-Setup` again — ready for a fresh configuration.

One day the WiFi router is replaced and the FlightWall can't connect. It retries for a while, then automatically falls back to AP mode. But Christian doesn't want to wait — he holds the reset button on the ESP32 during boot, forcing it into setup mode immediately. He connects from his phone, enters the new WiFi credentials, and the wall is back online.

**The moment:** The device recovers from problems without needing a laptop, USB cable, or reflash. Every recovery path works from a phone or the device itself.

**Reveals requirements for:** IP address display on LED matrix, factory reset via web UI, GPIO button forced AP mode, automatic AP fallback on WiFi failure

## IoT/Embedded Technical Requirements

### Hardware Reference

| Component | Specification | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| MCU | ESP-WROOM-32, 4MB flash, 520KB SRAM | Dual-core Tensilica LX6 @ 240MHz |
| LED Panels | BTF-LIGHTING WS2812B ECO 16x16 | 5050SMD, GRB color order, DC5V, alloy wires |
| PSU | Aclorol 5V 20A (100W) | AC input via NEMA 5-15P 18AWG cord |
| Level Shifter | HiLetgo 4-channel 3.3V-5V bi-directional | ESP32 GPIO → WS2812B data line |
| Data Pin | GPIO 25 (configurable) | Single data line to daisy-chained panels |

### Memory Budget

- **RAM:** ~170-240KB estimated usage, ~280-350KB headroom. Heap fragmentation is the primary risk — monitor with `ESP.getFreeHeap()` and `ESP.getMaxAllocHeap()`
- **Flash partition (MVP, no OTA):** ~2MB firmware, ~2MB LittleFS (web assets + logos)
- **Flash partition (post-MVP with OTA):** ~1.5MB firmware, ~1.5MB OTA, ~896KB LittleFS — requires custom partition table
- Limit concurrent web server clients to 2-3 to manage RAM pressure
- Stream files from LittleFS; do not load full files into RAM
- Consider ArduinoJson streaming/filter API to reduce heap pressure from 16KB → ~2-4KB per parse

### Critical Implementation Constraints

1. **FastLED + WiFi interrupt conflict (HARD REQUIREMENT):** FastLED disables interrupts during pixel output, disrupting the WiFi/async web server stack. The display update task **must** be pinned to Core 0 via `xTaskCreatePinnedToCore()`, keeping WiFi on Core 1. Alternatively, use the RMT/I2S peripheral driver for DMA-based interrupt-free LED output.
2. **Heap concurrency:** API fetch operations and web server file serving may compete for heap simultaneously. Acceptable for single-user use — document as known behavior.

### Web UI Dependencies

- **Leaflet.js** (~40KB gzipped) — Interactive map for location configuration with circle radius overlay. Loaded from CDN or bundled in LittleFS. Map tiles fetched at runtime from OpenStreetMap tile servers (requires internet — only used in config dashboard, not captive portal)
- No frontend frameworks — vanilla HTML/JS/CSS with a minimal reusable stylesheet for consistent spacing, typography, and color

### Connectivity

- **WiFi STA:** Primary mode — connects to home network for API calls and serves config UI
- **WiFi AP:** Setup mode — captive portal for first-boot configuration and WiFi fallback
- **Bluetooth:** Capability reserved, no defined use case. Compiled disabled for MVP (`CONFIG_BT_ENABLED 0`) to reclaim ~60KB RAM/flash. Enable when a use case emerges.

### Power Profile

- Full white at max brightness: ~192W theoretical (3200 pixels × 60mA) — exceeds PSU
- Typical operation at brightness 5-50/255: ~3-10W — well within 100W budget
- No battery operation; always wall-powered

### Security Model

- Local network only — no internet-facing services
- No authentication on web config UI (single-user, trusted network)
- API credentials stored in NVS (improvement over current compile-time headers)
- TLS for external API calls (currently using `setInsecure()` — acceptable for personal use)

### Update Mechanism

- **MVP (Phase 1):** USB flash via PlatformIO — connect ESP32 to computer, build and upload firmware. All configuration persists in NVS across reflashes; uploaded logos persist in LittleFS across reflashes
- **Post-MVP (Phase 2):** OTA firmware updates via web UI — requires custom partition table (1.5MB app + 1.5MB OTA + 896KB LittleFS) and one-time full reflash to apply new partition layout. After repartitioning, logos must be re-uploaded and NVS config re-entered
- **No automatic update checks** — user-initiated only. Device does not phone home or check for updates

### Known Trade-offs

- **MVP partition layout:** Simple 2MB app + 2MB LittleFS. Adding OTA later requires repartitioning and one-time full reflash — uploaded logos and NVS config must be re-entered. Conscious decision to maximize LittleFS space for MVP.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Display settings changes (brightness, color) must be reflected on the LED matrix within 1 second of submission
- Web config UI pages must load within 3 seconds on the local network
- Flight data fetch cycle must complete (API call + JSON parse + display update) within the configured fetch interval
- LED matrix frame rendering must maintain a consistent frame rate with no dropped frames during flight card transitions
- Captive portal setup wizard must be responsive — each page transition under 2 seconds

### Reliability

- Device must operate continuously without requiring manual restart (target: 30+ days of uninterrupted operation)
- Device must recover automatically from transient WiFi disconnections within 60 seconds of network availability without user intervention
- Device must recover from API failures (rate limits, timeouts, auth errors) by continuing to display last known data and retrying at the next fetch interval rather than showing error screens
- Configuration writes must be atomic — power loss during a config save must not corrupt stored settings
- Device must return to AP setup mode if stored WiFi network becomes permanently unreachable (after configurable retry timeout)

### Integration

- OpenSky Network API: Authenticated access with automatic credential refresh, rate-limited to stay within 4,000 monthly requests on free tier
- FlightAware AeroAPI: API key authentication, handle HTTP 429 (rate limit) and 5xx (server error) by retrying at next fetch interval
- FlightWall CDN: Public HTTPS GET for airline/aircraft name lookup, fail silently if unavailable (display falls back to ICAO codes)
- All external API calls use HTTPS (TLS)

### Resource Constraints

- Total firmware + web assets + logos must fit within 4MB flash with at least 500KB headroom
- Runtime RAM usage must stay below 280KB to maintain stable heap for concurrent web server + API operations
- Device filesystem operations must stream data — no full-file RAM buffering for uploads or logo reads
- Web server limited to 2-3 concurrent client connections to prevent heap exhaustion

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Heap fragmentation from ESPAsyncWebServer + TLS + JSON | Display glitches or crashes | Limit concurrent clients to 2-3, stream from LittleFS, monitor free heap |
| FastLED interrupt conflict with WiFi stack | Web server instability, WiFi drops | Hard requirement: pin display task to Core 0 |
| 4MB flash budget exceeded | Can't fit firmware + web assets + logos | Monitor partition usage, gzip web assets, cap logo count |
| NVS corruption on power loss during write | Config lost, device stuck | Use NVS commit transactions, fallback to compile-time defaults |
| Solo developer blocked on technical issue | Progress stalls | AI-assisted debugging, ESP32/FastLED community forums |
